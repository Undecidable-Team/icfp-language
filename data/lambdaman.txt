Welcome to the Lambda-Man course.\n\nIt was the year 2014, and many members of our community worked hard to control Lambda-Man. Now, ten years later, this wonderful event is still memorized by holding a small Lambda-Man competition.\n\nThis course will teach you how to optimally control Lambda-Man to eat all pills. There is no fruit involved (neither low-hanging nor high-hanging), and even better: no ghosts! The input to each problem is a simple rectangular grid such as the following:\n\n```\n###.#...\n...L..##\n.#######\n```\n\nThe grid contains exactly one `L` character, which is the starting position of Lambda-Man. There will be one or more `.` characters indicating the locations of pills to be eaten, and `#` characters are walls. The outside boundary of the grid is considered to consist of walls as well.\n\nA solution should be a string of `U`, `R`, `D` and `L` characters (up, right, down, left, respectively) indicating the path to take. For example, a possible solution to the above example grid is the following path:\n```\nLLLDURRRUDRRURR\n```\nWhen Lambda-Man is instructed to move into a square containing a wall, nothing happens and the instruction is skipped. Your solution may consist of at most `1,000,000` characters.\n\nThe following levels are available:\n* [lambdaman1] Best score: 33.\n* [lambdaman2] Best score: 44.\n* [lambdaman3] Best score: 58.\n* [lambdaman4] Best score: 151.\n* [lambdaman5] Best score: 142.\n* [lambdaman6] Best score: 73.\n* [lambdaman7] Best score: 139.\n* [lambdaman8] Best score: 125.\n* [lambdaman9] Best score: 114.\n* [lambdaman10] Best score: 164.\n* [lambdaman11] Best score: 1524.\n* [lambdaman12] Best score: 1588.\n* [lambdaman13] Best score: 1578.\n* [lambdaman14] Best score: 1565.\n* [lambdaman15] Best score: 1581.\n* [lambdaman16] Best score: 287.\n* [lambdaman17] Best score: 231.\n* [lambdaman18] Best score: 3521.\n* [lambdaman19] Best score: 1442.\n* [lambdaman20] Best score: 5264.\n* [lambdaman21] Best score: 9194.\n\nTo submit a solution, send an ICFP expression that evaluates to:\n\n```\nsolve lambdamanX path\n```\n\nYour score is number of bytes that the ICFP expressions consists of (i.e. the size of the POST body), so a lower score is better.\n
